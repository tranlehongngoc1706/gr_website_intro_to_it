            <p>Duong Tran My Linh - UI/UX Designer</p>
            <p class="p1">
                <p1>Greetings! I go by both my Vietnamese name, which is Duong Tran My Linh, and my Chinese name, Yun Mei Ling, as my dad was a Chinese businessman who immigrated to Vietnam mainly because of the prosperous growing economy here. 
                    Initially, I was an undergraduate at Foreign Trade University, one of the most prestigious universities in Vietnam, majoring in Banking and Finance. 
                    The fact that I had almost zero IT background compared to my coursemates, who either took up coding when they were young or are naturally gifted and intelligent, was one of the reasons that made people doubt my ability to keep up with this IT major at first. 
                    Nonetheless, what led me to the momentous decision of transferring to RMIT and switching to an Information Technology major, which is drastically different from my old one and is extremely male-dominated, was that I wanted to grab the opportunity of the limitless potential of technological applications in the economy, such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, and in our daily life. 
                    Furthermore, I want to change society’s perceptions and typical stereotypes which are always held against women and invalidate their true potential, in this particular technology field. Thanks to my previous academic credentials as a business major, I specialize in analyzing data and insights that support decision-making. 
                    Henceforth, the prominent role of implementing all of the user requirements and enhancing their experience by optimizing the graphic elements and building navigation components, or being a UI/UX designer, in short, will be dedicatedly fulfilled by me in our IT Project.

                Initially, I thought that Information Technology is unsuitable for me due to the fact that the people around me always tried to stop me from taking it as the common stereotypes would make people think that girls will not be able survive in this male-dominated field. 
                After having the opportunity to pursuit Information Technology in RMIT with the guidance of my wonderful, enthusiastic professors, teammates and seniors, I came to the realization that technology, in fact, is a form of art made by human. 
                Henceforth, I want to be able to demonstrate my limitless creativity under the form of technology as a role of UI-UX designer while understanding the demands of people around me and taking them all into account. 
                Furthermore, with my background as a business major, I understand how one company function and the management system in general work. 
                With a view to correlating the business field and the technology field all together, I also aim to be a Data Analyst/Project Management to have the grasp of the whole system by implementing technology into them.

            <p>Ngo Minh Hoang - Web Developer</p>
            <p class="p1">
            <p1>Hello, my name is Ngo Minh Hoang and my student ID is s3926829. I was born in Hanoi, but my family moved to Ho Chi Minh City when I was 10, and now I am currently a freshman at RMIT Vietnam’s SGS Campus.
                About my hobbies, football and chess are the two most enjoyable activities for me in my leisure time. Although I am not very good at playing it myself, watching the professional players competing is something I can do all day. 
                Talking about football – the most popular sport in the world, in recent years, the impact of technology on it is incredible. AI is used to analyze in-match statistics, AR and VR are used to enhance the live broadcast and allow the fans at home to view the action as if they were in the stadium, and much more. 
                All those things really influenced my experience of enjoying the game as a viewer, making me amazed at how “miraculous” it is, and it became one of my reasons to choose IT as my major. 
                I am extremely interested in the way technology affects our daily life and want to use my knowledge in this field to help contribute to the development of our society, bringing a better life to other people. 
                I used to take part in some IT-related projects back in secondary school, such as creating a game or building a simple website. 
                However, that was the story of many years ago, and now I have to learn everything again from zero. Without a doubt, this project could not be a better opportunity for me to gain more experience and start working on projects that will change our life.

                <p2>
                At the moment, I haven’t had a clear career plan yet. Two minors for IT students at RMIT that I am interested in are Data Analytics and Mobile & Web Development. 
                Being a data analyst or a programmer either sounds cool, but I am not sure which one would be more suitable for me. 
                My ideal job would be something that relates to my hobbies, but it doesn’t matter if I can have it or not since the technology itself is enough to fascinate me.

            <p class="p1">
                <p1>Hi, I am Hong Ngoc with the student ID s3938020. My mom comes from Hanoi but because I was born and raised in Saigon, I am only able to understand the Northern Vietnamese accent but not be able to use it. Of all my hobbies, I enjoy watching CSI TV series and football matches the most. Both hobbies enable me to realize how much I love seeing the world from different angles and analyzing the surroundings. This realization leads me, although not very directly, to the IT world, or the world of data science to be specific. 
                    Joining this course with only a few basic C++ knowledge does not seem to be a disadvantage to me, because the less I know, the bolder I am when making projects - because I see it as an opportunity for me to learn from testing and experimenting.

                <p2>At this point, data analyst is my dream job since I want to use my observation and knowledge to tell a story from raw data. I want to optimize my time studying at RMIT University to be the best version of myself before getting to work with other members of the data analyst team and other related teams such as data scientists and data engineers. 
                    Also, I am still seeking an efficient learning method, so that I can begin practicing some small projects to hone my skills.

                <p1>Howdy, my name is Ton Nu Ngoc Khanh, and one of the things I'm proud of is that my surname originates from a Hue royal. 
                    Everyone calls me Mango, s3932105 is the RMIT ID number to recognize me in RMIT. I've lived in Ho Chi Minh City for 19 years, where I cherish my precious memories with my relatives and friends, and I believe I will spend my whole dream here. 
                    Thanks to various scientific films, I've been fascinated with artificial intelligence since I was in grade 11. By the way, this is my first semester and my first step into AI, which was a dream come true. My hobbies used to be quite childish when I spent all of my time watching Netflix and listening to music, 
                    but I've recently noticed that since entering this new school environment, I've gradually changed; instead of watching Mukbang videos on Youtube, I now listen to videos about Python, HTML, and even CSS, which I find fascinating. 
                    Living in an increasingly contemporary world packed with everything inspires me to think about how I might help create technologies that will safeguard people and the environment in the future.

                    My current ideal job is AI Project Manager, I want to study all essential information during the following several semesters. 
                    By the way, a number of competitions and challenges will be held throughout the semester at RMIT, which will be one of the many ways I will complete myself and will get an IT background in order to improve my chances of landing an offer in the future

            <p class="p1">
                <p1>Hello everyone, my name is Le Hoang Anh Minh, my English name is Mia and I am from the team. I’m a first-year student at RMIT with a major in Bachelor of Information Technology.  I was born in Ho Chi Minh city but my hometown is in Hanoi, and I’m very proud of that. 
                    Everyone was surprised by that because I speak with a southern accent. In addition, I like cooking food and dessert, it makes me feel happy and relaxed. It can be said that that is the time when I feel most comfortable and be myself, I also have a passion to open a kitchen of my own. 
                    And there, I will spend my free time discovering and practicing more recipes for new dishes, that is for me to develop my skills so that I can open a small restaurant for myself.  Besides that, Psychology is one of the things I admire, this isn’t related to my major. 
                    This is probably the industry that I love most so far, although it is not really widely developed yet, but with scientific statistics that today young people have a very high risk of suffering from depression. . 
                    And so, for me, this industry is very important because it allows me to heal myself and help others to think in a positive way.

                <p2>My career arrangement isn't very related to my current major because it tends to be a lot of psychology. 
                    It's one thing I've really enjoyed since I used to be in high school, however what I learn currently will be very helpful within the future. I need to target my passion. 
                    Once I even have a solid foundation, I'll learn more things that may in all probability facilitate ME later just like the current IT industry.
