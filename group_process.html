    <h1>Group Process</h1> <br>
    <p>Our team is naturally formed after some chit-chats in class about our feelings as first and second semester students. During those conversations, Linh once shared her concern about the inconvenience of the product labels. We decided to do research to see whether it is appropriate to tackle this problem using IT applications and we found out that QR Codes are now accepted as the product label internationally. So Ngoc and Khanh based on the team strengths to allocate the members into three groups: designing the UI prototype, building website and writing report. Although our schedules sometimes overlapped, we still managed to meet the deadlines and produce high-quality work, as we discussed a clear plan since the beginning of the project. This plan not only includes the time for the members to cultivate design, coding and writing skills. In our original plan, we thought that we only be able to build the landing page for our actual web, and have to use QuestAi - a intermediary tool to automatically generate the Figma design to HTML for the other pages, because there are more CSS work to do as our websiteâ€™s targets are phone users.  However, with Ngoc and Hoang hard work, our website did not need to use QuestAi and still have two main features - beauty products and virtual beauty tools, alongside with the landing page.
