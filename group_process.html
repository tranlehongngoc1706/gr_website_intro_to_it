    <h1>Group Process</h1> <br>
    <p>Everyone on our team performed an outstanding job, meeting deadlines, 
    producing high-quality work, and staying abreast of developments. Ngoc 
    and Hoang were responsible for web development, while Linh assisted them 
    with UI/UX design and conducted research and analysis on fresh information. 
    Minh and Khanh will handle the report writing process. Despite the fact 
    that this is our first project together, we've made significant progress 
    in distributing work and managing our time. Hoang and Ngoc were given 
    the duty of creating a website for our group project proposal, which is 
    the next main part of the assignment. Additionally, Linh will be responsible 
    for user interface/user experience design. Linh and Hoang, in particular, 
    utilized Figma to create a beauty website based on samples Linh discovered 
    online. In addition to gathering the team profile, Ngoc and Khanh worked 
    together to make our website more eye-catching and dynamic by coding HTML and CSS 
    to upload all of the team's details, including the team name, personal information, 
    group process, and career plan. All of our HTML and CSS code for the website was uploaded into our Git repository 
    by Hoang and Ngoc using GitHub in order for the whole team to see their progress. That's not all; our work has also 
    been made available to the general public through GitHub, so anybody may see it. 
    Figma has been used by Linh and Hoang to design and finish the prototype of our group 
    project concept so that those outside of our project may see its interface and functioning. </p>
